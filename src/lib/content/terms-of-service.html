		take all necessary precautions to prevent unauthorized access to your account. Any activities that occur using
		your login credentials are deemed to be authorized by you and you are fully responsible for all resulting
		actions.
	</p>

	<p>
		SolidProof.io will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by unauthorized use of your account unless such
		unauthorized use is due to verifiable misconduct by SolidProof.io. If you suspect unauthorized access or misuse
		of your account, you are required to notify us immediately in writing.
	</p>

	<p>

		compensation. This also applies to services that had already been used or were planned at the time the account
		was blocked or closed.
	</p>

	<p>
		Prohibition of multiple accounts and account abuse Users are prohibited from creating multiple accounts unless
		expressly authorized by SolidProof.io. Abuse of multiple accounts, including but not limited to circumventing

		to date. SolidProof.io accepts no liability for any loss or damage caused by incorrect or out-of-date

		Responsibility for digital wallets <br />
		SolidProof.io does not offer its own digital wallets and assumes no responsibility for the management, security
		or use of the wallets used by users to carry out transactions or to participate in services on the platform.
		The responsibility for creating, securing and managing digital wallets lies solely with the user. SolidProof.io
		has no access to private keys or other security-relevant information of the wallets and is not liable for losses
